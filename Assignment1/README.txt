note: 
1. console print out for each call looks like this (with the exception of call 7 and 9):

start of call 8
17
-2
-2
array starting at index 0 from left to right:
-2, 0,
end of array



2. Errors out at call 10. Did not have time to debug: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'hasOwnProperty' of undefined"
3. Stack is printed out after every call with begin and end statements.
4. Technically the "returned" number is the last number printed on it's own line. In the above example it would be -2. 
   Ran out of time to make this pretty.


Thank you!
