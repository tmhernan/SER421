Build in map type structure:

3. session 
	-ends after a session, expire when brower closes
	
	
	-TO CLEAR: sessionStorage.clear() so that the keys no longer exist
	
4. local storage
	-remembers where you are in the app, application state
	-persist until browser runs out of room in memeory
	
	
	-TO CLEAR: localStorage.clear()



localstorage/session storage:
-Random replacements until all have been used (browser/session based?)
	-Save word used in session data if it's used and compare the var to that OR,
	-Save var dictionary in local storage. Save what's been used in session
		storage. Compare the two. If the random number exists in session storage
		already, create another random number. 

-LIST
	-if list has no reviews alert the user
	-lists all reviews and splits them up between censored and unsensored
		-save to session data
		-manipulate dom to show

session:
-COUNT number of bad words used in a session
	-on submit button, count the nubmer of words and add them to the session variable "count"


local storage/session storage:
-SEARCH for bad word and it returns all corresponding nice words
	-HISTORY of searched words, save the user's search history in session storage
		-with format (index, searched word), SHOWS them to user (manipulate dom to show)
- SAVE STATE: comments to be made stateful


CLEAR resets everything but most likely except the var dictionary saved in local storage
